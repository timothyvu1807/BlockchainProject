# BlockchainProject
CMPE130 Project

We will be coding a simple math game that allows the user to accumulate an in game currency and use blockchain technology to handle the transaction between the user and the shop interface.

**RULES**
User will be asked a series of math equations that consist of, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Addition questions will be worth the least, Subtraction will be worth more, and Multiplication will be worth the most.
Round Robin Mode: Consist of all 3 and will give you an even greater point multiplier.
Points can be spent in a shop.
